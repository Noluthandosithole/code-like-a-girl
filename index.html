<p align="center"><b> WHAT EXACTLY IS MENTAL HEALTH?</b> </p>
<p>Mental health is a term that covers a variety of issues relating to emotional and mental wellbeing</p>
<br>
<p>Mental health is something that's more than "more about how you feel" and also includes your reasoning, behaviors, emotions, responses to stressors, moods. When all of these things are aligned and working together smoothly it leads to a happier person who has generally less anxiety.</p>
<br>
<p>Mental health is a term that covers a variety of issues relating to emotional and mental wellbeing. It is important to keep in mind that the difference between having a mental illness and being mentally healthy, is not simply about whether or not you are currently experiencing symptoms. It's also about how you cope with stress, what your attitude towards your problems and challenges are, the way you maintain relationships with other people as well as other background factors such as social support structure.</p>
<p>Mental health is the level of emotional and psychological well-being. There is evidence, including a number of national surveys, that indicate many people do not have good mental health. This has led to larger studies about what may be causing it.

Mental health is something you can't measure with a test or scan. It's the things that make you who you are - what penetrates your deepest thoughts and how it impacts your life.

Mental health includes our spiritual, social, emotional, and psychological well-being. It means feeling okay about our body and looking after it - eating well, staying active, taking care of ourselves when we feel down or in pain. Mental health also means taking care of our minds by making free time for relaxing activities like reading a book or going for a walk so we don't daydream negative thoughts all the time! It deals with both feelings and functions.  For example one might have some serious problems mentally but still be able to function well</p>
<p>Mental health is a measure of the emotional and psychological well-being of an individual.

It is also linked to social and interpersonal functioning, including school performance for children and adults alike. People who are mentally healthy lead fulfilling lives and do not experience undesired mental states or poor social skills that affect their work, family, or other interests.</p>
