<p>Mental health is very serious issue which is growing because of lack of attention to this issue. It is a serious concern but people do not take it seriously. In today’s fast life everyone is busy with their life people don’t even have time to talk with their friends and family. </p>
<p>Another reason Mental health is a growing problem because of how can people freely say awful things on the internet to a specific person. Too much negativity is consumed by the brain which leads to stress and anxiety. Be mindful of your mouth and what comes out of it for we never know what situation a person is battling right now.</p>
