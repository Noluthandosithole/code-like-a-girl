  <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CAUSES</b></p>
<ul type="round">
<li>Life events such as long-term unemployment, living in an abusive or uncaring relationship, long-term isolation or loneliness, and constant work stress are all associated with depression. Recent life events such as losing your job, illness, an accident, or the death of someone close to you can trigger depression.</li>
<li>Personal factors such as family history, personality and drug and alcohol use can leave you more vulnerable to depression. People with a family history of depression are at greater risk, possibly because of genetic factors. However not everyone who has a parent or sibling with depression will develop it themselves. Personality traits — such as perfectionism, low self-esteem and a tendency to worry — can also make depression more likely, but here too the link is not direct.</li>

<li align="center"><b>ANXIETY</b></li>
<img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="img/a1.jfif" alt="a1" width="300px" height="300px">
<p>Anxiety is the body’s physical response to a threat or perceived threat. It causes a pounding heart, rapid breathing, butterflies in the stomach and a burst of energy as well as mental responses such as excessive fears, worries or obsessive thinking.</p>
<p align="center"></b>CAUSES</b></p>
<ul type="round">
<li>life-threatening events</li>
<li>consuming caffeine, as well as some non-prescription and herbal medicines</li>
<li>having a certain personality type, such as being a perfectionist, having low self-esteem or needing to be in control</li>
<li>substance use — particularly cannabis, amphetamines, alcohol and sedatives — or withdrawing from drugs and alcohol</li>
<li>physical health issues such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease or hormonal issues, such as thyroid problems</li>
