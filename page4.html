<li>We may also lose interest in things we once enjoyed. Task completion and time management may fall apart. It may also become difficult for us to concentrate, or one may have rumination and focus on cleaning or organizing.</li>
<li>Our relationship with food may change. We may have ups and downs, and racing thoughts can happen more often.</li>
<li>Life may become overwhelming. If we are having severe mental health issues, we may start to lose touch with reality and even hear voices.</li>

<tr>
<td>Expressing Your Emotions</td>
<td>Expressing your emotions is one of the best mental health solutions and helps you when you are having a tough time. Wearing the heart on your sleeve is not a symbol of weakness. You are taking care of your health by accepting the circumstances and trying the best you can to improve it. Mostly, interacting with others helps, as it solves the puzzles in which your mind might be tangled for quite a while. Only being heard would provide you with the company and confidence you are lacking. It will have an immediate and long-term impact on your mental health.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stay Active </td>
<td>Experts suggest that exercise causes the brain to produce hormones that help you feel healthy. By regular workouts, you can make yourself feel healthier and improve your concentration as well as raise your self-esteem.  Not only this, but exercising also aids in keeping your vital body organs, including the brain, fitter. Daily physical activity does not necessarily mean playing sport or hitting the gym. You may walk in parks, can do gardening in your backyard, or take care of house chores to stay busy. These solutions will make you feel confident and a positive thinker even in depressing situations.</td>
<td><img src="img/s2.jfif" alt="s2" width="250px" height="250px" ></td>
</tr>
<td>Proper Diet</td>
<td>A diet that is beneficial to your physical wellbeing is also beneficial to your mental wellbeing. A well-balanced diet can contain the following foods:  fruits and vegetables, cereals, nuts, dairy products, and a lot of water intake. Limit the intake of high-caffeine and sugary beverages and prevent excessive alcohol consumption. However, if you are feeling down, you can have sweets to boost your mood. It works! Healthy food assures a healthy mind. Start your day with a rich diet and end your day with a light one. The time at which you consume the food also plays a vital role in the rejuvenation of your mental conditions.</td>
<td><img src="img/s3.jfif" alt="s3" width="250px" height="250px" ></td>
</tr>
<br>
<tr>
  <td>Ask For Help (Mental Health Institutes)</td>
  <td>No one is superhuman. We are all frustrated or stressed at times because of how we think or whether problems occur. If things become difficult for you and you start believing that you are unable to manage, then it is better to seek assistance. You may contact a counseling service to motivate you in making improvements in your life, consult a therapist to help you cope with your emotions, or make a fresh start.

If unpleasant experiences are preventing you from moving on through your life, you should seek guidance from your doctor or a consultant specialist.</td>
<td><img src="img/s4.jfif" alt="s4" width="250px" height="250px" ></td>
</tr>
<br>
<tr>
  <td>Do What You Enjoy Or Enjoy What You Do</td>
  <td>It is worth mentioning that your commitments should coincide with your enjoyment. You need to pave the way for this by yourself. Though it is not always the case that you find pleasure in your routine tasks, like an office job, how about focusing on the salary?! Besides, in the leisure time, you can enjoy extra-curricular skills like painting, calligraphy, meditation, etc. Practice everything that makes you feel like escaping. You can even cry for hours. But for few hours only, do not ruin your shining and dreamy eyes.</td>
<td><img src="img/s5.jfif" alt="s5" width="250px" height="250px" ></td>
</tr>
<br>
<tr>
<td>Embrace Yourself</td>
<td>It is amazing to know that you are unique. Your strengths are unbeatable only if you realize them. To err is a human. No one is completely perfect. It is all okay to stammer. It is beautiful to have a bit tilted nose. Your real beauty is the power of self-acceptance. Face the mirror, pat your weaknesses. Not everyone is good at everything. You are the first one to accept the real you. Do not gaze at yourself with the world’s eyes. Not everyone can see the diamond in coal. Making mistakes is not a problem; sticking to them is. Admit your downfalls, work positively on them, and move on.</td>
<td><img src="img/s6.jfif" alt="s6" width="250px" height="250px" ></td>

<p>Everyone could suffer from behavioral or emotional health issues. Nonetheless, considering the prevalence of mental disorders, most of us make little attempt to improve our condition. We miss the emotional cues that something is off and continue to struggle with self-destructive activities. We bury our troubles in the expectation that no one will care and convince ourselves that this is “how we are.”

However, you should not feel guilty about it. Several mental health solutions are there to help you fight tough mental issues. Many platforms these days are offering mental health solutions, and one should never feel shy in seeking guidance from mental health experts.

May this society offer a helping hand to people suffering from mental health issues.</p>
